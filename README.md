# BASGRA NZ
### The BASic GRAssland model for New Zealand

The official release of BASGRA was developed jointly by Marcel van Oijen, Mats HÃ¶glind, David Cameron and Stig Morten Thorsen. A full description of the model can be found in the User Guide (BASGRA2014_USER_GUIDE) included in this release:

The BASGRA NZ project tracks modifications to BASGRA for application to perennial ryegrass in New Zealand conditions. The test data comes from the Seed Rate Trial 2011-2017. Modifications to BASGRA were necessary to represent this data.
